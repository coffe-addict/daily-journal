Hello, this is notes for git reset module.
git reset is used for moving a branch to point at a specific commit. 

Git reset will move your head to pointing at the position in the branch where you like it to revert to. 
i.e 
	
	If you wish to revert your working area and index to a status that you committed two commits ago.
	reset --hard will do the work for you.
	Two options to be used for reset :
			--hard :- this will first move the branch to the specified commit.
				then, it will copy from repository to working area and index.
			--soft :- this will move the branch to the specified commit. That's it.

			default is --mixed :- in moxed it will move branch to specified commit, and 
					then, it will copy from repository to index area only, leaving 
					working area untouched.
